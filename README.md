# smubia.org / smubia.github.io
The Home of SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics. We're large on reproducibility and open source code. Learn yourself some git and get started with helping us on content ;)

## Requirements

**TBD.** Setup Jekyll, bower, npm, bundle. 
npm install, bower install, bundle install,

## Getting Started

If you're on a **fresh installation**:

run `npm i` first to install all the npm modules we need. Important for running gulp!

Then run the following:

`npm start`

This tells npm to run gulp which will convert all our scss styles into css. Without this step, you won't see your styles updated.

`jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`

This will run jekyll using the config files relevant to your environment 
_config.yml is used on the server and _config_dev.yml is used on your local machine (the site.url differs for both)
