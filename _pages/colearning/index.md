## What Is It?

Lectures are boring (okay, not all but most) We understand that and taken to a new approach that **each co-learner takes ownership of their own learning.** We also understand that real learning does not happen if you have not applied what you learnt. Hence, every session will end with a **mini-project** that illustrates what you have learnt.

You will personally check a list of concepts and ensure that you have applied it. Fellow members in their co-learning groups will take turns to check each others' work and provide feedback. The more you provide feedback, the better everyone learns as a whole. This is our **projects driven, co-learning** approach.

While we understand that there is plenty of buzz about Deep Learning, Machine Learning, etc, we emphasize that we are largely **fundamentals driven.** Our belief is that by focusing too much on the buzz, you miss the fundamentals. By missing these fundamentals, you're literally building your future in analytics on shaky foundations. You will fall. As self-learners ourselves, by focusing on the fundamentals, we ensure that we are less susceptible to shifting trends in the analytics landscape. Trained on strong foundations, nothing will faze us.
