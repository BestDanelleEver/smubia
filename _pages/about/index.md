## Who We Are

SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics (BIA) is a student run club in Singapore Management University (SMU) that focuses on developing co-learning platforms in data science for students across disciplines and tertiary education institutions.

<br>

## Our Vision

Data analytics has proven to accelerate business outcomes for government, corporate and non-profit organisations, large and small, in many different ways.

BIA aims to enable undergraduate students to acquire, hone and apply competencies in data analytics via co-learning platforms and real-time industry collaborations.

BIA also hopes to bridge the gap between technology and business functions, where students develop a career mindset that embraces the convergence of digital competence with business leadership.

<br>

## Our Mission Statement

BIA leverages a co-learning community, comprising of students from across disciplines and educational institutions to accelerate learning outcomes in data science and sustain close collaborations with various industry and government organizations to give students the competitive edge in today’s data-driven economy.

Through this learning community, students across disciplines discover how analytics could be applied to solve teething issues in their domain of study; close industry collaborations also enable students to work on real-world data sets, maintain strategic feedback loops with existing practitioners, and test their solutions under close mentorship and guidance from university professors and qualified industry practitioners.

## Current Core Team

<br>

[**Gabriel Chuan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielchuan/)

Gabriel is currently exploring the use of data science in education technology. He does this by working part-time in an edtech company that's focused on using ML to help kids practice more efficiently and effectively for their studies. On the side, he's helping out with Data Science SG, taking notes and filming each meet-up to help spread the love of analytics in Singapore.

He has ***some "hacking"*** experience from attending hackathons, working on his own side projects, exploring new and experimental technology as a hobby. All of which is largely self learnt in study groups he has found or formed. Marrying his interests in data science, edtech, hacking and self-learning, he hopes to be able to help his peers through SMU BIA to form cohesive and sustainable learning communities. Really, it's all about motivating each other to learn and reach new heights. Isn't that what living is all about?
